title: How to Ask for Help as a Software Developer

I was talking with a software developer friend the other day who was asking for suggestions on how to increase their coding output. They kept getting stuck and taking too long with their tasks, and they wanted adivce on how to get more code written.

My advice was to ask for help better. By that I mean: ask for help sooner and ask for help in a way that makes it easy to be helped. I want to share what I told them because I think that a lot of developers face the same problem as they grow from junior to intermediate or senior.

I remember facing it. I solved the problem by asking for help sooner and by getting better at asking for that help.

## Why you need to ask for help

Developers hit this problem where they can get stuck and stay stuck too long. They're not making progress and they're not learning. They become _unproductively stuck_. I think this happens because of persistence. Computers are exacting, fickle, and pedantic. You need persistence to learn how to program computers.

In fact, I don't think that you can become a good software developer without encountering many roadblocks. You need to find your way around them, and that takes persistence.

However, that same persistence can backfire as you face more challenging and complex problems. Orders of magnitude more complex. It's easy to find the solution to a problem by searching google when the problem is rooted in an understanding of `for` loops. It's a lot harder to find a solution when the problems are rooted in multi-tenant microservice infrastructure, or virtual DOM reconciliation bottlenecks, or any number of weird and frustrating problems.

As your job becomes more difficult, relying solely on persistence to solve problems can backfire. The problems you have to solve grow and grow in complexity, so the tools you use to solve those problems need to grow too. Persistence is necessary, but insufficient.

Think about it another way: if you got stuck on a problem for two day when asking for help would have gotten you unstuck in a half hour, was that a good use of time? Is it helping you improve your skills? Is it helping you accomplish your task?

You probably work on a team. That team depends on you. When you get _unproductively stuck_, your team is depending on you to ask them for help. Try not to let your own persistence and determination get in the way of your goals and your team's goals.

## When to ask for help

There is a bit of a paradox. You need to ask for help, but not too soon because you need to be persistent to be a programmer. But don't wait too long, either, because it's not productive to stay stuck too long.

When do you give up and ask for help?

My answer is: asking for help is not "giving up." We'll see later how asking for help doesn't mean you stop working on the problem.

As an intern, I was told that I give up too easily and needed to stick with problems longer on my own before asking for help. I needed more persistence. That was a tough thing to hear, but I took it to heart.

But when _should_ you ask for help, then? Here's a starting point.

**Timebox yourself to a half hour. When you haven't made a meaningful progress on your task for 30 minutes, that is when to ask for help.**

A lot of developers tend to avoid interrupting someone to ask for help because they are either intimidated or afraid of asking a silly question. Let me tell you: high-performing teams ask questions. High-performing individuals ask questions. If you want to increase your performance and productivity, like my friend did, asking questions is something that you need to do.

I am one of the most senior engineers at my employer, and I intentionally make it a habit (in group meetings) to ask questions that I am fairly certain I already know the answer to. Part of this is to confirm my understanding and get more context, but part of this is to demonstrate to everyone that asking questions is normal and good. That even someone with my experience and seniority asks "silly" questions.

If you're still nervous about asking someone for help too often, then ask for feedback about that. Tell your manager or team that you'd like feedback on how frequently and how well you ask for help.

Help them help you.

## How to ask for help

Asking for help is something that you can follow a recipe for. You will refine your recipe over time, but here is my recommended starting point.

1. **Describe the problem**. First, you need to describe the problem that you're trying to solve. Describe the problem, but avoid describing the context. Instead, link to context. If you're stuck on a ticket, link to that ticket. Focus on describing the part that you're stuck on.
2. **List what you have tried so far**. Write out summaries of your approach so far and where they have failed to get you unstuck. Offer any ideas you might have about why they didn't work.
3. **Describe your next step**. Finally, you need to pick a next step and describe it. This is crucial because it keeps you working on the problem while the other person gets back to you. You're still responsible for solving the problem and asking for help can happen in parallel to you helping yourself.

Here's an example:

> Hi there. I've been working on [this ticket](https://example.com/) but when I showed up to work this morning, Xcode just stopped compiling code. Here is the compiler error:
>
> `/* compiler error goes here */`
>
> When I google the compiler error, I get a lot of results but none of them seem relevant to our code. I even tried including the framework listed in the compiler error, but couldn't find anything relevant. I think maybe this error just has so many causes that I'm looking for a needle in a haystack.
>
> I also tried pulling the from the repo to see if that would fix it, but I was already on the latest changes.
>
> I'm not sure what could have caused this, since the code was compiling yesterday afternoon. I didn't change my computer. Any ideas? I'm going to keep going down the rabbit hole searching for the compiler error for now.

If I got this message from a coworker, I would immediately recognize the problem. My guess is that some readers recognize it, too, based on their experience. It would take a few minutes to respond and unblock you.

You can see how the message follows the recipe. It describes the problem in an appropriate level of detail and links out to context. It lists the steps taken so far and the results. And it describes your next step so you can keep at it while the other person takes time to get back to you.

This message is also concise and to the point. This is important â€“ let me explain.

The same person who told me, as an intern, that I ask for help too soon also suggested that I ask for help _in writing_. He taught me that the process of organizing my thoughts would often lead me to new ideas when I had previously been stuck.

## Conclusion

As you can see, asking for help isn't something that you do _instead of_ trying to solve a problem yourself. It is just one tool in your problem-solving toolbox. It's often the best tool to reach for when you're stuck, but my friend Steve Hicks describes other tools in this excellent talk:

A lot of developers get stuck in the trap of persistence as they grow in experience and responsibility. It might be one of those things that just naturally happens as we grow from one level of responsbity to the next. I'm not sure. It's a behaviour that I continue to look out for in myself.

By the way, [I wrote my first blog post about how to ask for help](/blog/how-to-ask-for-developer-help/) ten years ago. It wasn't great, and the resouce I linked to is no longer available. [I tried writing the post again two years later](/blog/asking-for-help-in-open-source/), but that advice was specific to open source communities. Neither post captured what I told my friend, but this one does. I hope it's helpful for you, too.
