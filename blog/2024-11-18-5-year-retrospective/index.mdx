[Here is my last retrospective, from 2019](/blog/5-more-years-of-building-software/). It ended with some uncertainty.

> excited for the journey. Thanks for reading, and take care.

Hmm.

This retrospective is more of a personal lookback than strictly a career lookback, which follows the trend of the past two timelines. The first was very focused on my career, and I think that reflects my priorities at the time. I was building my career from the ground up, and it took a lot of effort. The second was more personal, still with some career aspects. This one is more personal still, discussing higher-level changes and less specific detail.

I think that's normal.

I'm left trying to conclude what has been a difficult and painful five years. My last retrospective concluded at the end of 2019, and I was optimistic. I didn't know where I would be in another five years, but I was "excited for the journey."

Looking back, the journey has been so hard. It makes me want to despair.

But there are bright, shining moments too. My virtual birthday party. A persistence to run. New friends. Old friends.

These years have seen me learn that I can't hide from the bad parts without missing the good parts. I was stuck, and I got unstuck. I do find joy when I look for it, so I choose to look for it.

I have never been more experience than I am today, and I've never felt more capable.

I am excited about the next five years. I choose to be.
