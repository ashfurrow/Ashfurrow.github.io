// TODO: Introduction

[Here is my last retrospective, from 2019](/blog/5-more-years-of-building-software/). It ended with some uncertainty.

> excited for the journey. Thanks for reading, and take care.

Hmm.

This retrospective is more of a personal lookback than strictly a career lookback, which follows the trend of the past two timelines. The first was very focused on my career, and I think that reflects my priorities at the time. I was building my career from the ground up, and it took a lot of effort. The second was more personal, still with some career aspects. This one is more personal still, discussing higher-level changes and less specific detail.

I think that's normal.

Something is better than nothing. And more is more.
