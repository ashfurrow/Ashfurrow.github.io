_Content warning: this post contains medical discussions._

Quickly after I began my career as a fulltime software developer, I developed pain in my left wrist. At first, it was only occasional. But it became consistent. Then it started showing up in my right wrist.

I waited longer that I wish I had to do anything about it. And I waited longer still to seek out professional help. Don't worry, though, because the story [has a happy ending](https://ashfurrow.com/blog/learning-to-walk/). It turns out that my posture was the problem and fixing that posture with exercise is the solution.

Today, I manage my wrist pain. It still flares up, but I now have the tools I need to deal with it. One of those tools has been ergonomics. I've tried wrist splints, better chairs, sit-stand desks, and... ergonomic keyboards.

This blog post is about the rabbit hole that I've been falling down in spurts and starts for over a decade. Let's start from the beginning.

# The journey so far

In 2015, I bought my first "split keyboard", the Kinesis Freestyle 2. This is a great keyboard and it remains my go-to recommendation for any programmer who wants a better keyboard.

TODO: describe tenting and benefits

The keyboard is great, but it has some flaws. It tents, it has integrated palm rests, and it comes in Mac and Windows variants. However, its two halves are connected by a wire that you can't change so it has limited adjustability. It's a membrane keyboard, so it doesn't feel great to type on.

But those are small tradeoffs for what you get: an open chest while typing. The problem that a lot of people have while typing for long periods of time is that they get hunched over. The pull the shoulders into a rounded position to try to meet the keyboard. A split keyboard like this lets you position the two halves so that your chest stays open. A keyboard should meet you where you are; you should not meet your keyboard.

**Getting a split keyboard is the single best thing you can do to improve your ergonomics as a programmer.** Everything from here, in my opinion, offers diminishing returns.

But diminish returns are still returns.

So at the beginning of the pandemic, I ordered an ErgoDox EZ from ZSA. TODO: What are the advantages of the ergodox over the freestyle?

I had been looking at it for a while and a coworker had one, so I pulled the trigger. This was my second mechanical keyboard, and I loved it.

I used the ErgoDox EZ for over four years. I didn't spend too much time customizing it. All the keys were blank, and honestly, I didn't use a lot of them. When I joined Float, I got a home-office stipend that I decided to use on new keycaps for the ErgoDox EZ, which was the beginning of me further customizing my keyboard layout.

With legends on my keys, I was able to remember what all of them did. I added print-screen keys, and paste-without-formatting keys, and all kinds of one-off keys that made my life a little easier. It was great!

The problem I had with the ErgoDox EZ was, ironically, the ergnomics. The keyboard tented, but only above the desk. And laying flat on my desk, I had to raise my hands to meet the keyboard. Sure, I used palm rests to help, but that led to another problem.

I take written meeting notes by hand, which means that I use my desk for more than just a keyboard and mouse. I would start every meeting by pushing my two keyboard halves and their wrist rests and my Magic Trackpad away from me to make room for my notebook. Then at the end of the meeting, I would pull all five pieces back and try to arrange them just-so. It frustrated me, for a few years. I eventually got lazy and started using my keyboard pushed back, so then I'm back to meeting my keyboard instead of having my keyboard meet me.

Hmm.

Luckily, ZSA came out with a new keyboard last year: the Voyager. I started playing around with my ErgoDox EZ layout to minimze the number of keys. I added homerow mods. I printed out to-scale outlines of both keyboards to compare. I thought really hard about what I wanted, and then I took the plunge.

# The Voyager Keyboard

- Build quality, fit and finish
- Switches (turns out I don't actually like clicky that much)
- Layout (layers are good, optimize for text editing)

# Tenting iterations

- Keyboard tray
- Tripod + trackpad
- Keyboard tray and magic arms
- Clamps suck (ughly and get in the way of my notebook)
