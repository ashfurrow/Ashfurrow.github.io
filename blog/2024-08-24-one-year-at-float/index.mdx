title: One Year At Float
date: 2024-08-24

Last August, [after much reflection](/blog/what-next/), [I joined Float](/blog/joining-float/). After a year, I thought it was important to check in with myself and see how I'm doing. How I'm feeling.

The tl;dr here is: I am proud of what I've accomplished at Float so far. I'm planning on staying for the long run. I will continue making Float the kind of place where I want to stay for the long run.

Most of my career has been spent in startups of various sizes. Recently, I tried working at a large publicly-traded company. Upon reflection, I don't think my time was well spent there. The work I did was good, but not great. The scale of my impact was impressive, but only relatively speaking. My work was valuable, but not valued.

Returning to an early-stage startup has been a breath of fresh air.

I joined in late August and by early December [Float had launched its mobile app](https://floatcard.com/introducing-the-float-mobile-app/) on Android and iOS. Financial services was a whole new domain to me and I had to get up to speed _fast_. I learned Float's existing products, met Float's customers, and asked many questions. I guided a small team across planning, designing, building, testing, and deploying a new product.

All in three months.

It turns out that I actually respond really well to external pressure. _I like it_. But I need to understand _why_ something is important. Two days before the app launch, a Sunday, we found a show-stopping bug. My evening was spent on a call with two other developers and our product manager: identifying the problem, fixing it gracefully, and deploying that fix to unblock our launch.

Afterward, I was asked how that experience felt. "Thrilling," I said truthfully.

It reminded me of some of [my best moments at Artsy](https://artsy.github.io/blog/2019/11/14/diagnosing-our-radiation-problems/). I had been on call during a multi-day incident. when it was over, my coworker told me:

> It’s rare and odd to say dealing with incident was fun, but with your help it actually was productive and fun.

Float reminded me how deeply I care about my vocation.

I have worked remotely before. My first year at Artsy was remote across an ocean. I thought I knew how to work remotely, but the pandemic was a shift for everyone. Since then, each job I've joined has been _as a fully-remote worker_. This has taught me the value of in-person interactions.

I can get a lot of code written alone in my home office. But anyone who has worked with me can tell you that the code I write is not often the most important contribution I have to make. My relationships with my coworkers and the context I gather from them helps me understand what is most urgent at any given time. Sometimes that's coding. Often it's something else.

In two years at my previous employer, I got to meet my coworkers in-person _once_. During my first year at Float, I have actually lost track of how many times I've met my coworkers in-person.

I feel grateful and privileged to be able to both work remotely _and_ develop in-person relationships at work.

It almost feels like a responsibilty. I have this opportunity to get exactly what I want in both my personal and professional life; it feels like a responsibility I have to make the most of it.

My first year at Float has been filled with challenges, both challenges at work and challenges in my personal life.

I feel a sense of accomplishment that is familiar but that I haven't felt in a while. It's odd. I think I started avoiding difficult challenges. I remembered doing hard things but I think that the trauma of the pandemic had pushed me to seek comfort. (I'm skipping over a lot of personal stuff that's happened since then, so I admit that this _is_ a simplification.)

Suddenly finding myself on the job market was a challenge. I knew the stakes so I took it seriously. It was stressful, but managing that stress became part of the challenge.

I realized that at some point, I had become cautious. Conservative in my career. Quiet at work. Afraid to rock the boat.

Float has presented me with a lot of challenges. Some are challenges shared by every startup at Float's stage. Some are challenges I wouldn't find elsewhere. Nearly half of my career was spent at Artsy, where I learned to work with art-adjacent people solving problems for the art world. Some of the skills that worked at Artsy don't work at Float, or need to be modified. It has given me a new lens with which to look at myself.

This year has seen me reconnect with a part of myself that isn't afraid to take risks. I've become confident again. Outspoken. Ready to do what I think is right.

Most software development is modifying a codebase that already exists; building an entirely new piece of software is rare and exciting. But it's also very risky. You need to lay a good foundation while knowing that your first attempt at a foundation probably won't work. You need to leave the right amount of wiggle room around specific decisions so you can pivot quickly later. It's very exciting.

[I applied my professional philosophy](/blog/building-better-software-by-building-better-teams/) and it worked. I focused on _learning how to build a great product_ as a team, and a great product fell out as a byproduct. This was a team effort, and I take a lot of pride in the supporting role I played leading that team. I made sure that every critical step, from `git init` to `yarn release`, was done as team so we could feel our sense of accomplishment and stay determined.

After this frenzy of product development and launch, I had the holiday break to catch my breath and think about what to do next. I hit the ground running in January, putting plans into action and gathering context for my next phase of technical, cultural leadership at Float. Stay tuned for more.

I know that my time at Float has already been worthwhile because I can feel it. I've grown. I am more competent and confident of a technical leader now than when I entered. I've learned a lot about software development and my technical skills are as sharp as ever. I've built products to a level of quality that I am satisfied with.

But most importantly, I have been an open an honest version of myself. I have "brought my whole self to work" at a time when [that sense of self is shifting](/blog/new-year-new-me/). Looking back, I attribute this to prioritizing the first criteria in my job search: find a company with good people. It's odd that in the uncomfortable setting of an early-stage startup

It’s rare and odd to say being at an early stage startup is comfortable, but with this team it actually feels comfortable to be myself. When I "do technical leadership" in my own unique way, I get encouraged to go further.

So much of what I bring to a company is building up context and relationships. I want to stay at companies a long time because I have increasing returns the longer I am there. Part of that work is making the company worth staying at for a long time, and I feel encouraged to make that happen.
